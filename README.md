   A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among 

   the nodes of a computer network. For this illustration, you can enter your

    transactions, see how the ledge building up, inspect each transaction, 

    and save your data to a csv file called blockchain.csv. 

  Please pay attention  to two things: 

  1) each transaction has its unique hash (64-character long) by using the
     hashlib.sha256() function, and 

  2) it has its previous hash attached (except for the first one).

  To see column 2 completely, refresh your screen after entering your first transaction."
